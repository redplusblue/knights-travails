## Features:

1. Allows the user to place a knight and pawn anywhere.
2. Finds the smallest path from the knight's position to the pawn's position.
3. Highlights all visited squares, and outputs their coordinates.

## What I used/learned:

1. JS: Data Structures, Esp. Trees and BFS.
2. Vite: A bundler that is faster than webpack, and has a better developer experience.

<br>

### What I did well (I think):

1. Code is clean and modularized.
2. Webpage is aligned and styled proportionately.
3. The webpage is relatively lightweight.

### What I could've done better (Working on it...):

1. Not compatible with mobile phones, smaller screens.
